            <h2>3. No Medical Advice Disclaimer</h2>

In this event, any information provided by our web app is not intended as medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any medical (or any other) concerns or decisions. We expressly disclaim any liability arising from reliance on the information provided.</p>
